Originally trained as a pharmacist, I stepped into the world of data with focus ranging from biostatistical methods to more applied fields in health economics and outcomes research. Currently, I work as a data analyst at [the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health (CBCH)](https://www.columbiacardiology.org/research/research-centers-and-programs/center-behavioral-cardiovascular-health) conducting analyses on the relationship between behavioral factors and cardiovascular outcomes, and also
My primary statistical and programming tools are R and SAS.  

Talk a little bit about my thesis



I graduated from the [University of Minnesota](http://www.sph.umn.edu/academics/divisions/biostatistics/) with a MS in biostatistics in 2010. In 2012 I began working toward my DrPH in biostatistics as a part-time student at [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics), where I am investigating statistical methods for the study of etiologic heterogeneity in epidemiologic studies under the advisement of [Dr. Shuang Wang](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sw2206) at Columbia University and [Dr. Colin Begg](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/colin-begg) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. I expect to graduate by the end of 2018.

I am a well-known R enthusiast, including serving on the board and being an active member of [R Ladies NYC](http://www.rladiesnyc.org/).
