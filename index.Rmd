Originally trained as a pharmacist, I stepped into the world of data with focus ranging from biostatistical methods to more applied fields in health economics and outcomes research. Currently, I work as a data analyst at [the Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health (CBCH)](https://www.columbiacardiology.org/research/research-centers-and-programs/center-behavioral-cardiovascular-health) conducting analyses on the relationship between behavioral factors and cardiovascular outcomes, and also lead one of the studies in the [CORDA program](https://www.genmed.columbia.edu/research/research-centers-and-programs/columbia-program-decision-analysis-chronic-disease-prevention) which look at the cost-effectiveness of adopting the [new ACC/AHA High Blood Pressure Guidelines](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2017/11/08/11/47/mon-5pm-bp-guideline-aha-2017) in the US. My primary statistical and programming tools include R, TreeAge and SAS.  

I received MPH degree in Health Policy & Management from [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/health-policy-and-management) in 2011 and went back for my DrPH in [Biostatistics](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) in 2013. For my dissertation, I am working on developing the new model-based clustering algorithms for zero-inflated data with the supervision of [Dr.Bin cheng](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/bc2159) and [Dr.Ken Cheung](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/yc632). My expected graduation date is December 2019.
